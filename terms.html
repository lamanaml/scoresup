                            <p class="blog-post-excerpt">In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or
concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or
otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved
only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single
neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration
service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the
event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these
Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and
Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or
indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree
that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be
determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms
and Conditions.

arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S
INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH
AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE
OTHER. Further, unless both you and Scores Up Financial Services, LLC agree otherwise, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over
any form of a representative or class proceeding.
